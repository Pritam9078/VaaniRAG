"""Sarvam Saaras v3 streaming STT relay.

Contract verified against Sarvam's WebSocket reference (2026-08-13):

    URL     wss://api.sarvam.ai/speech-to-text/ws
    Auth    Api-Subscription-Key: <key>   (connection header)
    Query   model=saaras:v3  mode=transcribe  sample_rate=16000
            language-code=unknown          (enables auto-detection)
            vad_signals=true               (START_SPEECH / END_SPEECH events)

    client -> {"audio": {"data": "<base64>", "sample_rate": "16000", "encoding": "audio/wav"}}
    client -> {"type": "flush"}
    server -> {"type": "data",   "data": {"transcript", "language_code",
                                          "language_probability", "metrics"}}
    server -> {"type": "events", "data": {"signal_type": "START_SPEECH"|"END_SPEECH"}}
    server -> {"type": "error",  "data": {"error", "code"}}

Why Sarvam rather than ElevenLabs
---------------------------------
The corpus is Indic. Saaras is trained for Indian languages and code-mixed speech, does
auto-detection across them, and `language-code=unknown` means a user can switch from Gujarati to
English mid-sentence without touching a setting. For a dataset that is MS MARCO translated into
fourteen Indic languages, the Indic specialist is the correct engineering choice — not a patriotic
one, a matching-the-data one.

Why the relay exists, and what it costs
---------------------------------------
The browser cannot hold the API key, so audio goes browser -> our server -> Sarvam. Sarvam's
endpoint is in India and the app server is in the US, so audio crosses the ocean twice. This is
measured and displayed as its own `stt` stage rather than folded into the answer budget — the
200ms SLO starts at *final transcript*, which is the first moment the retrieval pipeline has
anything to work on.

The honest fix is an ephemeral client token so the browser connects to Sarvam directly, removing
one ocean crossing. Whether Sarvam issues those is an open question flagged in the build log.
